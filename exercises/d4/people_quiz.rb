1. Line three is necessary because it makes @name an instance variable so that it can be used in other methods.
2. Because Person is a parent class of Engineer, we know that Engineer is a subclass.
3. There will be an error because Engineer has not yet been defined.

1. true
2. true
3. true

5. true
6. false
explanation: instance_of? (class) is only true if it is an instant of the specified class (differentiate between sub class and super class here). 
is_a? is true if it is an object of the class or is within a subclass of the specified class.
